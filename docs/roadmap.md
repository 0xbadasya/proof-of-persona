# Architecture Overview

This document describes the internal architecture of the **persona** project and how its components are structured to enable programmable, privacy-respecting onchain identities.

## Component Breakdown

### Core Modules

#### 1. `core/persona.ts`
Handles creation and validation of new personas. Generates UUIDs, stores metadata like alias, behavior model, and creation timestamp.

#### 2. `core/thoughts.ts`
Creates new thoughts signed by a persona. Connects with the signer module to ensure authenticity.

#### 3. `core/signer.ts`
Handles cryptographic signing and verification of thoughts using Ethers.js. Ensures only the correct private key can post as a given public identity.

#### 4. `core/style.ts`
Placeholder for future LLM/AI-powered analysis of a persona's writing style and tone.

#### 5. `core/memory.ts`
Logs significant actions to a local `memory.log` file. Useful for debugging or training future AI personas.

### CLI System (`cli/`)
Each file corresponds to a CLI command:

- `create.ts` â€“ Create new persona
- `init.ts` â€“ Wizard-based interactive setup
- `post.ts` â€“ Post a new signed thought
- `verify.ts` â€“ Verify last thought
- `list.ts` â€“ List all valid thoughts
- `profile.ts` â€“ Show current persona profile
- `export.ts` â€“ Export thoughts/personas with optional zip formatting
- `import.ts` â€“ Import JSON data into storage
- `clean.ts` â€“ Remove invalid thoughts
- `memory.ts` â€“ Log/view/clear memory
- `use.ts` â€“ Set active persona
- `whoami.ts` â€“ Show current active identity

### Storage Layer (`storage/`)
- `local.ts` handles read/write operations for:
  - `personas.json`
  - `thoughts.json`
  - `memory.log`
- Supports both full replace and merging on import

### Config System (`utils/config.ts`)
Manages the `.persona-config.json` file, which stores the currently selected active persona.

### Validation (`utils/validate.ts`)
Ensures imported or created data meets minimum structure and integrity requirements.

## Signature Verification Process

Every thought is signed using the private key set in `.env`. This signature is stored alongside the content. Verification is done with the associated public key using Ethers' `verifyMessage` function.

```ts
message = `${content}|${topic}|${timestamp}`
signature = wallet.signMessage(message)
recovered = verifyMessage(message, signature)
```

If `recovered === persona.publicKey`, the thought is valid.

## Design Philosophy

- **Local-first**: All data is stored on your machine, never sent to a server.
- **Portable**: Output is readable, exportable, and importable.
- **Composable**: The CLI can be integrated into bigger systems (e.g., DAO bots, AI agents).
- **Transparent**: Thoughts are cryptographically verifiable.
- **Future-ready**: Designed to support AI, LLMs, and decentralized reputation protocols.

## Planned Extensions

- IPFS/Arweave sync module
- ZK-proof support
- Multi-wallet and DID support
- AI-inferred style graph
- Persona reputation scoring
