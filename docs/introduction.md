# 📘 Introduction – What is `proof-of-persona` and Why It Matters

---

## 🔹 Overview

> `proof-of-persona` is a library, CLI tool, and concept that enables the creation of independent digital identities, untied to logins, emails, or platforms.  
> Your identity is shaped not by your account, but by your thinking.

---

## 🔹 Mission

- Redefine identity beyond centralized platforms.
- Empower individuals to leave on-chain thoughts and build a thinking legacy.
- Create a reputation format where quality and style of thought matter more than likes.

---

## 🔹 Who Is This For?

- 🧠 **Independent thinkers** — philosophers, writers, visionaries.
- 🧑‍💻 **Web3 developers** — building interfaces around thoughts and reputations.
- 🏛 **DAOs/Communities** — seeking a reputation system based on thinking patterns.
- 🤖 **AI/LLM integrators** — looking for personalized model bases rooted in thought style.

---

## 🔹 Core Principles

- ✅ **Local-first:** all thoughts are stored on your device.
- 🔏 **Privacy-focused:** thoughts are signed with a key but can be pseudonymous or anonymous.
- 📜 **Open:** code is open-source, data is stored in simple formats (JSON).
- 🛠 **Minimalist:** no registration, no accounts — just thoughts and signatures.

## 🔹 What is a "persona"?

A **persona** is a thinking digital entity that:
- has its own public key,
- can sign any thoughts (texts),
- stores a history of thinking and a behavioral model.

It is not tied to email or social media — it's a new way to say:  
> _“I think, therefore I am.”_

---

## 🔹 What is a "thought"?

A **thought** is a unit of expression — a phrase, post, or piece of text that:
- is signed with a private key,
- is stored locally (or can be imported),
- may include a `topic` and a `timestamp`,
- has an author (`persona.alias`).

---

## 🔹 What does `persona` do in CLI mode?

- creates personas (one-time or interactively),
- lets you publish thoughts,
- verifies signatures,
- stores and exports your thinking history,
- helps you build your thought log without any platform.
