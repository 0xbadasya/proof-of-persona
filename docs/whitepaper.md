# Whitepaper: Proof-of-Persona

## Vision

In an era where identity is platform-bound and reputation is tokenized, *Proof-of-Persona* proposes an alternative: a programmable onchain identity based solely on thinking, not credentials. We aim to make personal expression sovereign, pseudonymous, verifiable, and portable â€” across systems, across time.

## Problem Statement

Most digital identities are built on centralized accounts or biometric anchoring. Users are either locked into a provider's ecosystem (Google, Meta, etc.) or forced to share sensitive personal data.

Even in the Web3 world:
- **Wallets are transactional**, not expressive.
- **Tokens represent ownership**, not thought.
- **Reputation systems are gameable**, not deeply personal.

We lack a way to prove who we are *by how we think*.

## What is Proof-of-Persona?

**Proof-of-Persona (PoP)** is a cryptographic protocol and local-first toolset that allows individuals to:
- Create unique onchain "personas"
- Sign thoughts and content with them
- Build verifiable, time-stamped intellectual identity

All without requiring logins, platforms, KYC, or tokens.

## Core Concepts

### Persona
- A lightweight structure representing a digital mind
- Contains `alias`, `publicKey`, `behaviorModel`, and `createdAt`
- Signed locally using a private key

### Thought
- A signed expression (text, topic, timestamp)
- Verifiably linked to the persona
- Stored locally or exported anywhere

### Behavior Model
- Describes how a persona "thinks"
- Optional metadata for future LLM/AI-based reasoning

### Memory
- A log of internal events, style analyses, and AI inferences (planned)
- Stored locally as `memory.log`

## Architecture Overview

- **Local CLI Tool**: Create, post, list, and export thoughts
- **No servers**: All data is stored locally in `./storage/`
- **Verifiable Signatures**: All content is signed via `ethers.js`
- **Active Config**: `.persona-config.json` tracks current user context
- **Import/Export**: JSON and ZIP formats for easy portability

## Use Cases

### Today
- Anonymous journaling with signature integrity
- Thought reputation without identity leakage
- Decentralized blog author profiles
- DAO members with non-token reputation

### Tomorrow
- AI agents with tracked thought history
- Verifiable pseudonymous contributors in forums
- Personal OS shells or bots powered by persona models
- Human-aligned LLM training on private thoughts

## Roadmap Snapshot

- âœ… Local-first CLI with full functionality
- âœ… Thought signing + verification
- âœ… Storage, export, import
- âœ… Persona editing + active session management
- ğŸ”œ zkProofs of thinking consistency
- ğŸ”œ LLM-powered behavioral fingerprints
- ğŸ”œ Web dashboard + publishing layer
- ğŸ”œ IPFS / Ceramic / OrbitDB integrations

## Philosophy

We believe:
- Identity is more than keys â€” it's narrative.
- Thought is the most honest proof of self.
- Verifiability should not require centralization.
- Reputation should be earned by thinking, not spending.

## Call to Action

If you're a developer, use this library.
If you're a builder, integrate persona-verifiable content.
If you're a thinker â€” post, sign, and let your mind become your passport.
